	  The speech_database package performs text-to-speech conversion by using Google's speech synthesiser. 
	  It also provides a storage solution for synthesised speech.
	  Speech can be accessed by publishing a text string at the /speech topic. If no entry exists, the text will by synthesised and stored locally in an mp3 file. 
	  After an entry that corresponds to the text was found or created, a request to play the audio file is published at the /robotsound topic to be processed by the soundplay_node.py of the sound_play package.
